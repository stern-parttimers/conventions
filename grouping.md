# Grouping
---
  - purpose: make repos easier to locate 

  - rules:
    - groupings will be similar to directories in a file system, except the delimeter is a dash "-" rather than a forward-slash "/"

  - examples:
    - upload installation scripts for installing CA certs for windows and for rhel
        - create repos install-cert-windows-2019 and install-cert-rhel-7-apache
        - note: to relate back to the file system analogy, `windows` and `rhel` would be subdirectories in the `cert` directory
